        <div class="about-me1">
            <p class="p1"><i>My name is Manav Mehta and I was born on 10th April 2006, in the United States of America. My ethnicity is Indian. Like many people, I also have a lot of interest in computers. I also have an interest in a lot of things like art, sports (mainly football), reading books and scientific blogs. I like reading Harry Potter books. I also like to read the classic comics of Tintin and Asterix & Obelix. I enjoy Mediterranean and Italian cuisine. Currently, I'm in grade 10th studying at Delhi Public School. My favourite subject is science (mainly biology). In 5th grade, I was elected as the house captain in my school. Under my term as the elected house captain, our house was able to secure the award for the "Best House" and the "Best in Sports House".</i></p>

            <p class="p2"><i>Since childhood, I have always had an interest in computers. My earliest memory of using a computer was when I was around 5 years of age. Since then my curiosity has been kept increasing. The first-ever application I had used was Microsoft-Paint. That sparked an interest in graphic art in me. But as time went on, my potential with computers also increased. Now my curiosity had become to explore how do these brilliant and exceptionally smart machines work. This led me to discover command-promt. From that point, I went to find out more about programming languages. The first programming language I learnt was html. Making websites was a topic of interest for me. Soon I went to start to learn about C and Python.</i></p>
