                    <p>Hey, my name is Manav Mehta. I am currently a student studying at Delhi Public School, Bangalore East, yet to graduate. I am very fond of computers and have also taken a lot of computer science courses. My interest in computers started at a very early age. Since childhood, my fascination with computers has just kept on increasing.</p> <br>
                    <p>I have learnt a lot of languages throughout my journey in programming. I have learnt python, html, css, SQL, Swift and C. The languages that I am most confident with are python, html and css. My expertise in computers is Web Designing, Artificial Intelligence and iOS applications.</p><br>
                    <p>I have worked on several projects like making Discord bots in python, various AI programs and even a few iOS apps of my own. I have collaborated and worked with several people who are experts in the field of python programming and machine learning. You can check all my lifetime projects by clicking the "Projects" button in the navigation bar.</p><br>
                    <p>Most of my projects are open to all and are free of cost! You can download these projects on my Github account. If any queries you can contact me via my email provided below.</p><br>
                    <p>I have learnt most of the programming languages from the cs50 course! I would highly recommend cs50 courses for beginners who are trying to find their way into the world of computer science. Till now I have completed the cs50x course and am learning artificial intelligence through cs50ai.</p><br>
